/**
 * CHANGE THIS PLEASE
 * This address list allows both the ROS code and communicaiton protocol to understand what
 * I am trying to send them. It's essentially a big lookup table.
 * 
 * The code is okay, what's bad about this is that you have to manually ensure that ids are synchronized
 * between both codes. i.e. that the packet_id.hpp file is always the same. 
 * 
 * You can just make a submodule of this with the custom_msg and so you have:
 *      - custom_msg
 *      - generate_structs.cpp
 *      - packet_definition.hpp
 *
 * All in the same module. Talk with the future Software SE to see if we can add these three files somewhere in ERC_SE_CustomMessages
 *
